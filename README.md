# About Me

I am passionate about **Physics** and **Data Science**, with a strong focus on **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)**. I love to explore ways to use data to drive innovative solutions to real-world problems. I have a background in **Physics Engineering**, and I'm continuously expanding my expertise in ML and DL to create smarter, data-driven systems.
